    <h3><strong>A little bit about me</strong></h3>
    <p>I am currently finishing my second year at CSU and preparing to take Physics 2 this upcoming summer in my home state, Minnesota. 
        <br/>
        This school year was my first year on campus and I have fallen in love with my classes and living in Colorado.</p>
    <h2><strong>Manufacturing experience</strong></h2>
    <p>At the beginning of this school year, 
      I had never heard about machining metals. 
      <br/>
      I did not know what a lathe, milling machine,
     or CNC machine was.
     <br/> Being so unfamiliar with manufacturing and living in a new state
      was initially stressful for me, 
      <br/>
      but I never realized how much I would learn. In fact, 
      I have never learned more during a semester of school.
      <br/>
       MECH 200 opened my eyes to the
       world of manufacturing and helped me realize that nearly everything around me 
       
       was produced 
      using the manufacturing processes we learned in this course.</p>
